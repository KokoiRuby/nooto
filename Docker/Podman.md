:confused: What is [Podman](https://podman.io/)?

- A open-source platform (CR & command-line tool) to manage conatiners, pods and images.
- Considered as Docker replacement



:smile: **vs. Docker?**

- Daemonless, cli to CR directly.
- Rootless, enahanced security & isolation
- OCI compatible



:confused: Install?
